// Objective

// Today, we're practicing bitwise operations. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

// Task

// We define s to be a sequence of distinct sequential integers from 1 to n; in other words,s = {1,2,3,...n} . We want to know the maximum bitwise AND value of any two integers, a and b (where a < b), in sequence s that is also less than a given integer, k.

// Complete the function in the editor so that given n and k, it returns the maximum a & b < k .

// Note: The & symbol represents the bitwise AND operator.

// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of function calls.
// Each of the q subsequent lines defines a dataset for a function call in the form of two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n and k.
